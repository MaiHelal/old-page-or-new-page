# Analyze website pages 
* we use A/B hypothesis testing in python to help company find out whether the new website landing page has higher usersâ€™ convert rate than old page using Pandas and Matplotlib.
* By using regression analysis using two method -- Using loop to similate 10,000 experiment using numpy.random.choice() function and another method is to use StatsModel package to run logistic regression model.
* merge another dataset and measure effect of country factor using sklearn and interpret results with practical reasoning.
Introduction
Part I - Probability
Part II - A/B Test
Part III - Regression
results
The p-value associated with ab_page is 0.190. The null in c-e part is that there is no difference between the treatment and control group. Alternative hypotheses is that there is difference between between the treatment and control group
Part II assumes the old page is better unless the new page proves to be definitely better at a Type I error rate of 5%, compared to question c-e,they have different explainory varibale or factor for the result.
The results appear the p_values for all factors > 0.05 (alfa error) that indicate we Fail to reject the null hypothesis .
As a final conclousion we can say that Country has no great effect on page conversion in addition, and old page shows aslightly higer conversion rate than the new page , so the decision is to keep the old page.
